# Hi, Thank You For Checking Out This Mini Project - EJS Blog Website Project

## About This Project:

What the application does: This is a blog website that allows the user to navigate over to "Create A Post" and input the post's title & text.

Motivation Behind Creation: The motivation behind this project was to build upon the fundamentals of EJS & the framework's ability to create templates and layouts, in addition to learning more about the concepts of Express Routing for the back-end.

How To Deploy:
1) Git Fork or Git Clone this repository to a designated location on your desktop.
2) Navigate to your terminal & install the npm dependencies with: npm install
3) Run the server using the following command "node app.js" or "nodemon app.js" 
4) Navigate over to localhost:3000 and create your first post at "Create A Post"

Key Learning Points Included:
- Develop fundamental understanding of Express Routing in the backend.
- Introduced the concept of layouts & templating through EJS.
- Applied the concept of global scope by globally declaring variables/arrays & using them in other functions.

Technologies Used: 
- HTML
- CSS (BootStrap)
- Node.js
- Express.js 
- Nodemon (Node Package) - Monitors changes in your sourcecode and automatically restarts server for faster local development.
- Body Parser (Node Package) - Used to parse incoming request bodies to allow for POST Requests to be made to the backend server.
- Heroku - to deploy the application on the internet. 
- Lodash - A JavaScript library that makes it easier to work with JavaScript inside Node/Express.
